## Assignment
7. Use the hfi dataset from the `openintro` package
8. Fit a new model that uses  `pf_expression_control` to predict `hf_score`, or the total human freedom score.
9. Again add region to the model from Q4. Compare the slope and $R^2$ with the model from Q4.

10. Finally fit a model with `ef_money` and `pf_expression_control` as exposures and `hf_score` as outcome.  Compare the slope and $R^2$ from the models from Q1. Could `ef_money` be a confounder? 

11. Use a linear regression model (and scatter plot) with  `ef_money` as exposure and `pf_expression_control` as outcome, to study whether `ef_money` has an association with `pf_expression_control` as well. This might validate our finding that `ef_money` is a confounder between  `pf_expression_control` as exposure and 
`hf_score` as outcome from Q6.

## Solutions
7.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)

hfi_2016 <- hfi %>%
  filter(year == 2016)
```

8.
```{r}
m1 <- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
m2 <- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control + region, data = hfi)

slope1 <- m1$coefficients["pf_expression_control"]
slope2 <- m2$coefficients["pf_expression_control"]

r1 <- summary(m1)$r.squared
r2 <- summary(m2)$r.squared

#knitr::kable(
  data.frame(
    "slope_pf_expression_control" = c(slope1, slope2),
    "r_squared" = c(r1, r2),
    row.names = c("m1", "m2")
  )
#)
```

The slopes are $$m_1 \approx `r round(slope1, 2)`$$ and $m_2 \approx `r round(slope2, 2)`$.

The $R^2$ values are $R^2_1 \approx `r round(r1, 2)`$ and $R^2_1 \approx `r round(r2, 2)`$.

10.

```{r}
m3 <- lm(hf_score ~ ef_money, data = hfi)
m4 <- lm(hf_score ~ pf_expression_control + ef_money, data = hfi)

slope3 <- m3$coefficients["ef_money"]
slope4 <- m4$coefficients["ef_money"]

r3 <- summary(m3)$r.squared
r4 <- summary(m4)$r.squared

knitr::kable(
  data.frame(
    "slope_ef_money" = c(slope3, slope4),
    "r_squared" = c(r3, r4),
    row.names = c("m3", "m4")
  )
)
```

We can see that when adding `pf_expression_control` as an additional exposure to the model `hf_score ~ ef_money`, the slope for `ef_money` decreases from `r round(slope3, 2)` to `r round(slope4, 2)`, and the $R^2$ value only increases from `r round(r3, 2)` to `r round(r4, 2)`. This suggests that `ef_money` may be a confounder regarding the outcome `hf_score` with the additional exposure of `pf_expression_control` as the slope decreases and the $R^2$ values indicate that the variance explained by the model does not increase as much as expected when combining the variables.

11.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ggpubr)

m5 <- lm(pf_expression_control ~ ef_money, data = hfi)

summary(m5)

ggscatter(hfi, x = "ef_money", y = "pf_expression_control", add = "reg.line") +
  stat_cor(aes(label = paste(..rr.label.., ..p.label.., sep = "~`,`~")))
```

This validates that `ef_money` is a confounder between `pf_expression_control` as exposure and 
`hf_score` as outcome.
